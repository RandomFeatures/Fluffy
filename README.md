# Fluffy
This is the very first game I ever wrote. I started the first version of fluffy sometime in early 1998. 
The game was really just to poke fun at Ultima Online. Somewhere over the years I lost the source code to Fluffy 1.0, but I can offer you a look at 2 and 3. Both project have a zip file including the original exe if you want to have a look.

## Fluffy I

This was a really simple game. You use the mouse to move the main character around the screen and when he collided with an enemy character that character would let out a death cry and vanished. The world scrolled endlessly so it was easy to get lost and not be able to find all of the enemies that you had to kill, Other than getting lost there was no real way to lose the game.

## Fluffy II 

Fluffy II was still a pretty simple game. Improvements over Fluffy I included the main character launching fireballs at the enemy and the enemy moving in small circles to be harder to hit. I also added cheat codes just for fun.
